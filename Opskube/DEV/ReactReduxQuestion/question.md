E-commerce websites are known for their fast-paced environment, where updates and changes are made regularly. One such feature that needs to be updated is the product counter, which displays the number of products available in stock. The development team at an e-commerce company has decided to implement a counter app using Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the product count.

The requirements for the counter app are as follows:

The initial state of the counter should be 0.
When a product is added, the count should increment by 1.
When a product is removed, the count should decrement by 1.
There should be a display component that shows the current count.
Your task is to write a Redux-based solution using Redux Toolkit that satisfies these requirements.

Please go ahead and implement the necessary actions, reducers, and store configuration to create this counter app. You can use any additional libraries or tools necessary to complete this task.

Note: Assume that you already have React set up in your environment and only focus on implementing the Redux-related code.
