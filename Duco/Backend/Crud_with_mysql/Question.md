E-commerce Giant, ShopEasy, is developing a new Node.js based inventory management system. The system will be integrated with their existing MySQL database to store and retrieve product information. The development team needs to establish a connection between the Node.js application and the MySQL database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Write a Node.js code snippet that establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the popular npm package mysql2. Assume the database credentials are: username - 'inventory_user', password - 'invent0ry_p@ss', host - 'localhost', and database name - 'shop_easy_inventory'.
