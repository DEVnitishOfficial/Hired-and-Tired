FloBiz, a SMB Tech company, is expanding its myBillBook platform to support multiple payment gateways for its users. As a Backend Development Intern, your task is to design and implement a payment gateway interface using OOP concepts and principles.

Currently, myBillBook supports only one payment gateway, Paytm. However, the company wants to integrate multiple payment gateways such as PayPal, Razorpay, and Google Pay. The system should be able to handle different payment gateway APIs, error handling, and logging mechanisms.

Write a pseudo-code to design an abstract class PaymentGateway with methods processPayment() and getPaymentStatus(). Also, implement concrete classes PaytmPayment, PayPalPayment, and RazorpayPayment that inherit from PaymentGateway. Ensure that your design follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open-Closed Principle (OCP) of OOP.

You can use any programming language of your choice to write the pseudo-code.
